## 🎯 What’s the Goal?  
This challenge is about:  
1. Strengthening my **digital design skills** and understanding of **Verilog HDL**.  
2. Exploring and building **practical projects** (e.g., gates, arithmetic circuits, state machines, etc.).  
3. Learning how to debug, simulate, and visualize designs effectively.  
4. Contributing to the **open-source community** by sharing my work.

## 🔗 How to Use  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the desired day's project folder:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathu2k4/75_Days_Of_Verilog.git
   cd 75_Days_Of_Verilog
   ```

2. **Explore Projects**  
   Inside each day’s folder, you’ll find:  
   - A Verilog module (e.g., `basic_gates.v`)  
   - A testbench file (e.g., `testbench.v`)  
   - Instructions for simulation in the `README.md` file  

3. **Run Simulations**  
   Use **Icarus Verilog** to compile and simulate the designs:  
   ```bash
   iverilog -o output_file module.v testbench.v  
   vvp output_file  
   ```  

4. **Visualize Waveforms**  
   Open the `.vcd` file in **GTKWave** to analyze the simulation results.

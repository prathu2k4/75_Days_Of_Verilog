# 🚀 75 Days of Verilog Coding Challenge  

Welcome to my **75 Days of Verilog** journey! 🎉 Over the next 75 days, I will implement various **Verilog designs**, ranging from **basic logic gates** to more **complex combinational and sequential circuits**, exploring the exciting world of **digital design** and **hardware description languages**.  

💻 Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional, feel free to follow along, give feedback, and join me on this learning adventure!

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker  
Here’s how I’m documenting my daily progress:  

| Day | Project Name            | Description                          | Link                          |
|-----|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Basic Logic Gates       | AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR, NOR         | [Day 1 - Basic Gates](./Day01)  |
|  2  | (Coming Soon)           | 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧               |                               |

Keep an eye on this tracker as I upload each day’s project. I’ll be expanding this list as I progress further! 🚀

## 🛠️ Tools and Technology  
Here are the tools I’m using throughout this challenge:  

- **🔧 Icarus Verilog**: For compiling and simulating Verilog designs  
- **📊 GTKWave**: For visualizing waveforms and analyzing simulation results  
- **📁 GitHub**: To document and share all my projects with the community  

---

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?  
This challenge is about:  
1. Strengthening my **digital design skills** and understanding of **Verilog HDL**.  
2. Exploring and building **practical projects** (e.g., gates, arithmetic circuits, state machines, etc.).  
3. Learning how to debug, simulate, and visualize designs effectively.  
4. Contributing to the **open-source community** by sharing my work.

## 🔗 How to Use  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the desired day's project folder:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathu2k4/75_Days_Of_Verilog.git
   cd 75_Days_Of_Verilog
   ```

2. **Explore Projects**  
   Inside each day’s folder, you’ll find:  
   - A Verilog module (e.g., `basic_gates.v`)  
   - A testbench file (e.g., `testbench.v`)  
   - Instructions for simulation in the `README.md` file  

3. **Run Simulations**  
   Use **Icarus Verilog** to compile and simulate the designs:  
   ```bash
   iverilog -o output_file module.v testbench.v  
   vvp output_file  
   ```  

4. **Visualize Waveforms**  
   Open the `.vcd` file in **GTKWave** to analyze the simulation results.

# üñ•Ô∏è Day 48: 4-bit CPU in Verilog  

Welcome to Day 48 of my **75 Days of Verilog Coding Challenge**! üéâ  

Today, I implemented a **4-bit CPU** in Verilog. This basic CPU performs arithmetic and logic operations using an **Accumulator-based architecture**, making it a fundamental building block for simple processors.  

---  

## ‚ú® Project Overview  

The **4-bit CPU** supports:  
- **Accumulator Register (`acc`)** for storing computation results.  
- **Basic ALU Operations:**  
  - **ADD** (`0001`): Adds operand to accumulator.  
  - **SUB** (`0010`): Subtracts operand from accumulator.  
  - **AND** (`0011`): Bitwise AND with accumulator.  
  - **OR** (`0100`): Bitwise OR with accumulator.  
- **8-bit Instructions:** Consist of a **4-bit opcode** and a **4-bit operand**.  

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `clk`: System clock  
  - `reset`: Resets the accumulator  
  - `instruction`: 8-bit instruction (4-bit opcode + 4-bit operand)  
- **Output:**  
  - `acc`: 4-bit accumulator register

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

- **Instruction Decoding:** The first 4 bits (`instruction[7:4]`) represent the **opcode**, while the last 4 bits (`instruction[3:0]`) represent the **operand**.  
- **Operation Execution:** The CPU performs the required operation based on the opcode.  

```verilog
case (opcode)
    4'b0001: acc <= acc + operand; // ADD
    4'b0010: acc <= acc - operand; // SUB
    4'b0011: acc <= acc & operand; // AND
    4'b0100: acc <= acc | operand; // OR
    default: acc <= acc;
endcase
```  

This simple CPU **mimics the execution flow of real processors**, handling arithmetic and logic operations efficiently.

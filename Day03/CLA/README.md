# 🛠️ Day 3: Carry Look-Ahead Adder in Verilog  

Welcome to the implementation of a **Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)** as part of my **75 Days of Verilog Coding Challenge**! 🎉  

---

## ✨ Project Overview  

The **Carry Look-Ahead Adder** is a high-performance digital adder used in arithmetic circuits. Unlike a ripple-carry adder, the CLA computes carry values in parallel, significantly reducing propagation delay.  

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a[3:0]`: 4-bit first operand  
  - `b[3:0]`: 4-bit second operand  
  - `cin`: Carry-in bit  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `sum[3:0]`: 4-bit sum of the inputs  
  - `cout`: Final carry-out bit

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Generate and Propagate**:  
   - **Generate (`g`)**: Indicates whether a carry will be generated by a bit position.  
     g[i] = a[i] ∧ b[i]
   - **Propagate (`p`)**: Indicates whether a carry-in will propagate to the next bit position.  
     p[i] = a[i] ⊕ b[i]

2. **Carry Computation**:  
   The carry for each bit is computed using the formulas:
     
      `c[1] = g[0] + (p[0].c[0])`

      `c[2] = g[1] + (p[1].c[1])`
  
      `c[3] = g[2] + (p[2].c[2])`
  
      `c[4] = g[3] + (p[3].c[3])`

4. **Sum Calculation**:  
   The sum for each bit is calculated using the propagate values and the carry bits:  
   sum[i] = p[i] ⊕ c[i]

## 🛠️ Simulation Steps  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathu2k4/75_Days_Of_Verilog.git
   cd 75_Days_Of_Verilog/Day03/CLA
   ```

2. **Compile and Simulate**  
   Run the following commands:  
   ```bash
   iverilog -o cla_tb carry_lookahead_adder.v tb_carry_lookahead_adder.v
   vvp cla_tb
   ```

3. **View Waveforms**  
   Open the generated `carry_look_ahead_adder.vcd` file in GTKWave:  
   ```bash
   gtkwave carry_look_ahead_adder.vcd
   ```

## 💡 Key Learnings  

- **Carry Look-Ahead Logic**: Learned how to calculate carry bits in parallel for faster addition.  
- **Testbench Optimization**: Used nested `for` loops in the testbench to exhaustively test all input combinations.  
- **Waveform Validation**: Verified results by observing signal transitions in GTKWave.
